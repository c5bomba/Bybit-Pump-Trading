The provided Python script utilizes the PyBit and Telethon libraries to receive messages,  filter them, and potentially open positions based on bullish or bearish sentiment.


PyBit: This library facilitates communication with the Bybit cryptocurrency exchange via API. The bot likely utilizes PyBit to open and close positions.
Telethon: This library enables control of your Telegram account through Python. The bot uses Telethon to receive Telegram messages.
Message filtering: The bot receives Telegram messages and filters them based on specific keywords or phrases.
Sentiment analysis: The bot analyzes the filtered messages to determine whether they convey bullish or bearish sentiment. This can be achieved through simple keyword matching or more sophisticated sentiment analysis techniques.
Position opening: The bot opens positions based on the perceived sentiment. For instance, it might open a long position (buy) if it detects bullish sentiment. Conversely, it might open a short position (sell) if it detects bearish sentiment.

I'm encountering issues with Bybit and will be switching platforms to avoid these problems. The main culprit seems to be trade latency â€“ trades are delayed by 1-2 seconds due to the physical distance between Bybit's servers (likely in Asia) and Bybit's data centers. This setup might work well for users with Telegram accounts based in Asia, but for others, it introduces unnecessary delays.
